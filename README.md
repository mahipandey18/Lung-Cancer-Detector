# Lung Cancer Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
This project is a deep learning based web application that detects lung cancer from CT scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model predicts whether the uploaded lung CT image is:
- 🟢 Normal
- 🔴 Cancer

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pillow

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Files Included
- app.py → Streamlit web application
